"""
cache.py — persistent per-provider crawl cache, the thing that keeps daily
re-runs inside a free LLM tier.

Two facts make LLM calls skippable on re-runs:
  1. A URL's classification verdict ("is this a single-card page?") almost
     never changes — cache it by URL and only classify newly discovered URLs.
  2. Extraction output only changes when the page content changes — cache a
     sha256 of the cleaned page text alongside the extracted record, and
     reuse the record whenever the hash matches.

The first crawl of a provider pays full price (~100 LLM calls); every run
after that costs a handful of calls for genuinely new/changed pages. The
cache lives at data/{provider}/crawl_cache.json and is safe to commit (the
GitHub Actions workflow does), which is what carries the savings across CI
runs. Deleting the file is the manual "re-crawl everything" switch.

Staleness tradeoff, on purpose: a page that changes category (e.g. a
catalog page later becoming a product page) keeps its cached verdict until
the cache file is deleted. That's rare enough that free re-runs win.
