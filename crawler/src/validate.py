"""
validate.py — Stage 5 of the pipeline: sanity-check extracted data before
it's allowed to overwrite the published dataset.

Philosophy: never auto-publish blind. Range violations are hard rejects.
Large day-over-day swings are soft flags — they don't block the update,
but they get logged and surfaced in the run summary so a human notices
"Chase Sapphire's APR halved overnight" before a user sees it.
